# Preassignment 1

Before the first class, please complete the following tasks. There are seven tasks, but most should be quick and straightforward. 

Completing the pre-assignment will ensure you have all of the accounts and software needed to follow along with the first session that covers the basics of computing literacy for optimization and statistics:
#### Computing Tools
- Executing commands in Terminal 
- Version control with Git + Github
- Distributed computing on the Engaging cluster
#### Writing and Organizational Tools
- Typesetting in LaTeX 
- Managing citations with Zotero

## Task 1: Make a Github account

We will be using Github to distribute code throughout the course. Please go to [www.github.com](www.github.com) and make a free account.

## Task 2: Install Git

Please navigate to [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git. Follow the installation instructions (you might already have it installed) for your operating system.

For Windows users, the download will include Git Bash. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash (a popular default shell on Linux and macOS), some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system. 

Open terminal (macOS/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows). "Clone" the Github for this class by entering the following command (we will talk about this more in the session):

`git clone https://github.com/kscummings/15.S60_2022.git`

This will create a copy of the Github course materials in the folder to which you cloned. **Take a screenshot of your terminal/PuTTY output after successfully cloning.**

## Task 3: (Windows only) Download PuTTY

We will be accessing Engaging through an SSH client. Windows users should navigate to [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) to download PuTTY. Mac users will be able to access Engaging through terminal.

## Task 4: (Sloan/ORC only) Access Engaging cluster

Sloan and ORC affiliated students are eligible to get access to the Engaging computing cluster. If you are not Sloan/ORC, then skip this step. You will not be able to code live in Engaging during this section on Tuesday, but many of the principles we cover will still be useful to learn.

In order to login, you first need to request an account [here](https://mitsloan.service-now.com/sloanservice?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=cdc71c54db10401479297deaae9619ba). This may take a day or two (don't worry if you can't get access before class).

Once your account has been created, login to Engaging.

If you're using Mac/linux, type `ssh <kerberos_user_name>@eosloan.mit.edu` into the terminal and enter your password. If you're using Windows, you will need to open PuTTY (see previous task), enter host name `eosloan.mit.edu`, and click "Open". Login with your MIT Kerberos username and password.

In this session, we will use julia on Engaging, and we need to install a few packages. Once you've logged into Engaging, check to ensure you can run the following commands (don't worry if you don't understand what we're doing here - we'll discuss during the session):

1. ```srun --pty --partition=sched_any_quicktest --cpus-per-task=1 --mem=2G bash```  (Note: this may take a few minutes depending on how busy the cluster is)
2. ```module load julia/1.5.2```
3. ```julia``` (At this point, a Julia session will open)
4. Enter the following commands:

```julia
julia> println("Hello, World!")

julia> exit()
```
5. **Take a screenshot of your commands/outputs for #1-4. This will be submitted in Canvas.** If your Engaging account has not been created by the time the pre-assignment is due, instead take a screenshot of your Engaging account request email.

## Task 5: Make an Overleaf account

We will be using Overleaf to cover the basics of LaTeX. Go to [www.overleaf.com](www.overleaf.com) and make a free account.

## Task 6: Download Zotero and create an account

Zotero is a tool to help organize and cite papers. Download Zotero and a browser connector here [https://www.zotero.org/download/](https://www.zotero.org/download/). Create a Zotero account here [https://www.zotero.org/user/register](https://www.zotero.org/user/register).

## Task 7: Submit screenshots on Canvas

Put the two screenshots from Tasks 2 and 4 in a single PDF file and submit on Canvas. If you are not affiliated with Sloan/ORC and do not have access to Engaging, just submit the screenshot from Task 2.
